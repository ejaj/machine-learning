Ottino1,3 & Lu\\xc4\\xb1\\xcc\\x81s A. Nunes Amaral1,3,4\\n\\nThe role of mentorship in prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 performance is a matter of importance to academic, business and governmental organizations.\\nAlthough the benefits of mentorship for prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s, mentors and their\\norganizations are apparent1\\xe2\\x80\\x939, the extent to which prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s mimic\\ntheir mentors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 career choices and acquire their mentorship skills is\\nunclear10\\xe2\\x80\\x9316. The importance of a science, technology, engineering\\nand mathematics workforce to economic growth and the role of\\neffective mentorship in maintaining a \\xe2\\x80\\x98healthy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 such workforce\\ndemand the study of the role of mentorship in academia. Here we\\ninvestigate one aspect of mentor emulation by studying mentorship\\nfecundity\\xe2\\x80\\x94the number of prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s a mentor trains\\xe2\\x80\\x94using data\\nfrom the Mathematics Genealogy Project17, which tracks the mentorship record of thousands of mathematicians over several centuries.\\nWe demonstrate that fecundity among academic mathematicians is\\ncorrelated with other measures of academic success. We also find\\nthat the average fecundity of mentors remains stable over 60 years of\\nrecorded mentorship. We further discover three significant correlations in mentorship fecundity. First, mentors with low mentorship\\nfecundities train prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that go on to have mentorship fecundities\\n37% higher than expected. Second, in the first third of their careers,\\nmentors with high fecundities train prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that go on to have\\nfecundities 29% higher than expected. Finally, in the last third of\\ntheir careers, mentors with high fecundities train prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that go on\\nto have fecundities 31% lower than expected.\\nA large literature supports the hypothesis that prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s and mentors\\nbenefit from the mentoring relationship1,2. Prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that receive career\\ncoaching and social support, for instance, are reportedly more likely to\\nhave high performance ratings, a higher salary and receive promotions1,3. In return, mentors receive fulfilment not only by altruistically\\nimproving the welfare of their prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s, but also by improving their own\\nwelfare4,5,10. Organizations benefit as well, because prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s are more\\nlikely to be committed to their organization6,7 and to exhibit organizational citizenship behaviour6. These benefits are not obtained only\\nthrough the traditional dyadic mentor\\xe2\\x80\\x93prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 relationship, but also\\nthrough peer relationships that supplement prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 development8,9.\\nThe benefits of mentorship underscore the importance of understanding how mentors were in turn trained to foster the development\\nof outstanding mentors. It might be suspected that prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s learn\\nmanagerial approaches and motivational techniques from their mentors and, as a result, emulate their mentorship methodologies; this\\nsuggests that outstanding mentors are trained by other outstanding\\nmentors. This possibility is sometimes formalized as the rising-star\\nhypothesis11,12; it postulates that mentors select up-and-coming prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s on the basic of their perceived ability and potential and past\\nperformance10,13,14, including promotion history and proactive career\\nbehaviours12. Rising-star prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s are reportedly more likely to\\nintend to mentor, resulting in a \\xe2\\x80\\x98perpetual cycle\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of rising-star prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that emulate their mentors by seeking other rising stars as their\\nprote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s15.\\nHowever, there is conflicting evidence concerning the rising-star\\nhypothesis16, so the extent to which prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s mimic their mentors\\n\\nremains an open question. Indeed, we are unaware of any studies that\\nsystematically track mentorship success over the entire career of a\\nmentor, so the validity of the rising-star hypothesis has yet to be fully\\nexplored. Here we investigate whether prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s acquire the mentorship skills of their mentors, by studying mentorship fecundity, that is,\\nthe number of prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that a mentor trains over the course of their\\ncareer. This measure is advantageous as it directly measures an outcome of the mentorship process that is relevant to sustained mentorship, allowing us to quantify the degree to which mentor fecundity\\ndetermines prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 fecundity.\\nScientific mentorship offers a unique opportunity to study this\\nquestion because there is a structured mentorship environment\\nbetween advisor and student that is, in principle, readily accessible18,19.\\nWe study a prototypical mentorship network collected from the\\nMathematics Genealogy Project17, which aggregates the graduation\\ndate, mentor and prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s of 114,666 mathematicians from as early\\nas 1637. This database is unique in its scope and coverage, tracking the\\ncareer-long mentorship record of a large population of mentors in a\\nsingle discipline (see the MPACT Project (http://ils.unc.edu/mpact/)\\nfor a smaller database of theses on information and library sciences\\nand references therein). From this information, we construct a network in which links are formed from a mentor to each of his k prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s, where k denotes mentorship fecundity. We focus here on the\\n7,259 mathematicians who graduated between 1900 and 1960, because\\ntheir mentorship record is the most reliable (Methods).\\nAlthough the mentorship records gathered from the Mathematics\\nGenealogy Project provide the most comprehensive data source available for the study of academic performance throughout a mathematician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career, there are obviously other plausible metrics for evaluating\\nacademic performance20\\xe2\\x80\\x9322. We have also compared the mentorship\\ndata against a list of publications for 4,447 mathematicians and a list of\\n269 inductees into the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS;\\nMethods). We find that mentorship fecundity is much larger for\\nNAS members than for non-NAS members (Fig. 1a). We further find\\nthat the number of publications is strongly correlated with fecundity,\\nregardless of whether or not a mathematician is an NAS member\\n(Fig. 1b). These results demonstrate that although fecundity is not a\\ntypical measure of academic performance, it is closely related to other\\nmeasures of academic success. Thus, even though our investigation\\nconcerns how fecundity is correlated between mentor and prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81, our\\nresults also address questions in the academic evaluation literature\\nconcerning the success of a mathematician.\\nWe first investigate whether it is possible to predict the fecundity of\\na mathematician by modelling the empirical fecundity distribution,\\np(kjt), as a function of graduation year, t. Considering that some\\nmathematicians remain in academia throughout their careers whereas\\nothers spend only a portion of their careers in academia, it might be\\nexpected that there are two types of individual when it comes to\\nacademic mentorship fecundity\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x98haves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98have-nots\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the\\nsense that mathematicians from these types respectively have or have\\nnot had the opportunity to mentor students throughout their career.\\n\\n1\\nDepartment of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA. 2Datascope Analytics, Evanston, Illinois 60201, USA. 3Northwestern\\nInstitute on Complex Systems, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA. 4Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA.\\n\\n622\\n\\xc2\\xa92010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We estimate the\\nparameters H 5 {ph, kh, khn} of this distribution from the empirical\\ndata using expectation maximization23. Using Monte Carlo hypothesis testing (Methods), we have found that equation (1) cannot be\\nrejected as a candidate description of the fecundity distribution p(kjt)\\n(Fig. 2a\\xe2\\x80\\x93c). For an alternative description of p(kjt), see Supplementary\\nDiscussion and Supplementary Fig. 1.\\nAs might be expected, the probability, ph, that an individual is a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98have\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experiences drastic changes over time as a result of historical\\nevents, such as the First and Second World Wars, the beginning of the\\nCold War and considerable increases in academic funding (Fig. 2d).\\nIn contrast, the average fecundities of \\xe2\\x80\\x98haves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98have-nots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 do not\\nexhibit systematic historical changes, suggesting that these quantities\\noffer fundamental insight into the mentorship process among mathematicians (Fig. 2e, f). For the sixty year period considered, we find\\n\\x16h 5 9.8 6 0.4 and k\\n\\x16hn 5 0.47 6 0.03, where the overbar indithat k\\ncates a time average of the respective average fecundity.\\nThe stationarity of kh and khn also provides a simple heuristic for\\nclassifying an individual as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98have\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or a \\xe2\\x80\\x98have-not\\xe2\\x80\\x99; by maximum\\nlikelihood, an individual is a \\xe2\\x80\\x98have\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if k $ 2 and is a \\xe2\\x80\\x98have-not\\xe2\\x80\\x99 otherwise. These results raise the possibility that similar features, perhaps\\nwith different characteristic scales of fecundity, may be present in\\nother mentorship domains.\\nAlthough our description of the fecundity distribution has highlighted a fundamental property of mentorship among mathematicians,\\nit is not predictive of the behaviour of individual mathematicians in the\\nsense that fecundity, according to this model, is a random variable\\ndrawn from the distribution in equation (1). We next test whether\\nprote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s mimic the mentorship fecundity of their mentors, by comparing prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 fecundity with a suitable null model that does not\\nintroduce correlations in fecundity.

All other attributes of these networks are randomized using a\\nlink-switching algorithm25,26 (Methods), so neither of these randomnetwork ensembles introduces correlations between parent fecundity\\nand child fecundity or temporal correlations in fecundity.

If the data were consistent with a branching process,\\nthen we would expect \\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6 to have no temporal dependence. However,\\nthe regressions between the \\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6 z-score (Methods) and tc 2 tp deviate\\nsignificantly (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4c) from this expectation\\nfor both random ensembles, to reveal three distinct features. First,\\nmentors with kp , 3 train prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that go on to have mentorship\\nfecundities 37% higher than expected throughout their careers.\\nSecond, in the first third of their careers, mentors with kp $ 10 train\\nprote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that go on to have fecundities 29% higher than expected.\\nFinally, in the last third of their careers, mentors with kp $ 10 train\\nprote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that go on to have fecundities 31% lower than expected.\\nThe fact that mentors with k , 3 train prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s with higher-thanexpected fecundities throughout their careers is somewhat counterintuitive. From the rising-star hypothesis11,12, it might be expected\\nthat prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s trained by mentors with k , 3 are likely to mimic their\\nmentors and therefore have lower-than-expected fecundities. Our\\nresults demonstrate that this is not the case. One possible explanation\\nis that mentors with k , 3 are more aware of the resources they must\\nallocate for effective mentorship, leading to a more enriching mentorship experience for their prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s. An alternative hypothesis is that\\nmentors with k , 3 select for, or are selected by, prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s that have a\\ngreater aptitude for mentorship.\\nThe striking temporal correlations for mentors with kp $ 10 are\\nalso intriguing. Because mentors with kp $ 10 represent the upper\\nechelon of mentors in mathematics, these mentors were probably\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98rising stars\\xe2\\x80\\x99 early in their academic careers. The fact that these mentors train prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s with high fecundities early in their careers supports the rising-star hypothesis.\\nBy the end of these mentors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 careers, however, their prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s have\\nlower-than-expected fecundities. Perhaps mentors, who ultimately\\nhave high fecundities, spend fewer and fewer resources training each\\nof their prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s as their careers progress. Alternatively, prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s with\\nhigh mentorship fecundity aspirations might court prolific mentors\\nearly in their mentors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 careers whereas prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s with low fecundity\\naspirations might court prolific mentors later in their mentors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 careers.\\nOur findings therefore reveal interesting nuances to the rising-star\\nhypothesis.\\nIt is unclear whether the temporal correlations we discover in mentorship fecundity generalize beyond mathematicians in academia.\\nAnecdotally, mathematicians are thought to perform their best work\\nat a young age27, a perception that may influence how mentors and\\nprote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s choose each other. Perceptions in other domains, however,\\nmay differ and subsequently influence mentor and prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 selection in\\ndifferent ways. As data for other academic disciplines18,19, business and\\nthe government becomes available, it will be important to determine\\nwhether temporal correlations in fecundity are a general consequence\\nof mentorship or are a particular consequence of mentorship for\\nmathematicians in academia.\\nRegardless, our results offer another means of judging academic\\nimpact in science as well as the impact of managers on their employees, both of which are notoriously complicated and risky affairs.\\nThese assessments are multidimensional, metrics and expectations\\nare domain dependent, and placement of creative output, timescales\\nof impact and recognition vary significantly from field to field.\\nUltimately, the assessment of individuals for awards and promotion\\nis based on painstaking individual analysis by selection committees\\nand peers. Although these committees may have varying goals and\\nincentives, it is important that collective arguments\\xe2\\x80\\x94the kind of\\narguments we are making here\\xe2\\x80\\x94be based on sound quantitative\\nanalysis.

We also note that the average fecundity of\\nchildren born to parents with kp $ 10 decreases throughout their parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nlives. b, We quantify the significance of these trends during each decade\\n(coloured symbols) by computing the z-score of the average child fecundity,\\n\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6, compared with the average child fecundity in networks from ensemble I.\\nThis information is summarized by identifying the linear regression (solid\\n\\nblack line; slope and intercept as shown). The regression lines for networks\\nfrom our null model (grey lines) vary around the expectation of our null\\nmodel (dashed black line). c, Significance of linear regressions in b. We\\ncompare the slope and intercept of the empirical regression (black circle)\\nwith the distribution of the slope and intercept of the same quantities\\ncomputed from the null model. Because these quantities are approximately\\ndistributed as a multivariate Gaussian, we compute the equivalent of a twotailed P value by finding the fraction of synthetically generated\\nslope\\xe2\\x80\\x93intercept pairs that lie outside the equiprobability surface of the\\nmultivariate Gaussian (dashed ellipse). The slopes and intercepts of the\\nregressions for children of parents with low (P 5 0.009) and high (P , 0.001)\\nfecundities are significantly different from the expectations for the null\\nmodel, consistent with the data displayed in a. Comparisons with\\nexpectations from random networks from ensemble II yield the same\\nconclusions (Supplementary Fig. 4).\\n\\npresented here will serve to elevate the discourse on scientific and\\nmanagerial impact.\\n\\nAverage-fecundity z-score. By the central limit theorem, the average of variates\\ndrawn from p(kcjtc) is normally distributed because p(kcjtc) is well described by a\\nmixture of discrete exponential distributions that has finite variance. Given a set\\nof child fecundities, Kc 5 {kc}, we quantify how significantly a subset of these\\nchild fecundities, Kc* , Kc, deviates from Kc by measuring the z-score of \\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6, the\\naverage child fecundity of all nodes within the subset Kc*, compared with \\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6s,\\nthe average child fecundity computed for children within a subset equivalent to\\nKc* in the synthetic networks. That is, we compute z 5 (\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6 2 m)/s, where m is\\nthe ensemble average of {\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6s} and s is the standard deviation of the ensemble\\n{\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6s} over the 1,000 realizations generated for our null models.\\n\\nMETHODS SUMMARY\\nData acquisition. We use data from the Mathematics Genealogy Project17 to\\nidentify the 7,259 prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 mathematicians that are in the giant component28 and\\ngraduated between 1900 and 1960, of which 4,447 have linked publication\\nrecords through the American Mathematical Society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research database\\nMathSciNet. We use a text-matching algorithm29 to semi-automatically match\\nmembers of the NAS with mathematicians from the Mathematics Genealogy\\nProject.\\nMonte Carlo hypothesis testing for p(kjt). We use Monte Carlo hypothesis\\ntesting30 to determine whether equation (1) with maximum-likelihood23 parameters H can be rejected as a candidate model for p(kjt) at the a 5 0.05 significance level.\\nRandom-network generation. We use a variation of the Markov chain Monte\\nCarlo algorithm25,26 to construct each of the 1,000 random networks in ensembles\\nI and II. Specifically, we restrict the switching of end points of links p R c that\\nbelong to the same link class L, where the link classes are defined as\\nLI(t) 5 {p R cjtc 5 t} and LII(s, t) 5 {p R cjtp 5 s, tc 5 t} for networks from\\nensembles I and II, respectively. Each link class can be thought of as a subgraph,\\nwhich can then be randomized in the usual way by attempting 100 switches per\\nlink in the class25,26.\\n\\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of\\nthe paper at www.nature.com/nature.\\nReceived 21 December 2009; accepted 19 March 2010.\\n1.\\n2.\\n\\n3.\\n4.\\n\\nKram, K.

We study a prototypical mentorship\\nnetwork collected from the Mathematics Genealogy Project17, which aggregates\\nthe graduation dates, mentors and advisees of 114,666 mathematicians from as\\nearly as 1637. From this information, we construct a mathematician genealogy\\nnetwork in which links are formed from a mentor to each of his or her k prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s.\\nThe data collected by the Mathematics Genealogy Project are self-reported, so\\nthere is no guarantee that the observed genealogy network is a complete description of the mentorship network. In fact, 16,147 mathematicians do not have a\\nrecorded mentor and, of these, 8,336 do not have any recorded prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81s. To\\navoid having these mathematicians distort our analysis, we restrict our analysis\\nto the 90,211 mathematicians that comprise the giant component28 of the network; that is, we restrict our analysis to the largest set of connected mathematicians in the mathematician genealogy network.\\nAlthough the Mathematics Genealogy Project contains information on mathematicians from as early as 1637, this does not necessarily indicate that all of these\\nrecords are representative of the evolution of the network. For example, before\\n1900 the Project records fewer than 52 new graduates per year worldwide.\\nFurthermore, because mathematicians often have mentorship careers lasting\\n50 years or more, we are not guaranteed to have complete mentorship records\\nfor mathematicians who graduated after 1960. We therefore restrict our analysis\\nto the 7,259 prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 mathematicians who graduated between 1900 and 1960, for\\nwhom we believe that the graduation and mentorship record is the most reliable.\\nMathSciNet data. Of the 7,259 prote\\xcc\\x81ge\\xcc\\x81 mathematicians that graduated between\\n1900 and 1960, 4,447 of them have linked MathSciNet publication records,\\nwhich are used in our analysis.\\nUS National Academy of Science data. The US National Academy of Science\\nmaintains two databases of its membership. The first database consists of all\\ndeceased members elected to the NAS from as early as 1863. This database\\nrecords the name of the inductee, their election year, their date of death and a\\nlink to a biographical sketch. The second database consists of all active members\\nof the NAS. This database records the name of the inductee, their institution,\\ntheir academic field and their election year.\\nThe challenge to matching this data with the Mathematics Genealogy Project\\ndata is that there is no direct link between a member of the NAS and the\\nMathematics Genealogy Project, and vice versa. This is further confounded by\\nthe fact that some members of the NAS have the same name. To circumvent these\\nproblems, we use a text-matching algorithm29 to semi-automatically detect whether\\na member of the NAS matches a name in the Mathematics Genealogy Project\\ndatabase. We use this procedure to curate the 269 members of the NAS that\\ndefinitively match mathematicians in the Mathematics Genealogy Project database.\\nMonte Carlo hypothesis testing for p(kjt). Given a model, M, with parameters\\nHt for the empirically observed fecundity distribution, p(kjt), we use Monte\\nCarlo hypothesis testing to determine whether it can be rejected as a candidate\\nmodel for p(kjt) (ref. 30). The Monte Carlo hypothesis testing procedure is as\\nfollows. First, we calculate the best-estimate parameters, ht, for model M at time t\\n\\nusing maximum-likelihood estimation23. Second, we compute the test statistic, S\\n(detailed below), between the model M(Ht) and the empirical fecundity distribution, p(kjt). Next, we generate a synthetic fecundity distribution, ps(k), from\\nmodel M(Ht) using the best-estimate parameters, ht, and we treat the synthetic\\ndata exactly the same as we treated the empirical data: first, we calculate the bestestimate parameters, Hs, for model M from maximum-likelihood estimation;\\nsecond, we compute the test statistic, Ss, between the model M(Hs) and the\\nsynthetic fecundity distribution, ps(k). We generate synthetic fecundity distributions and their corresponding synthetic test statistics until we accumulate an\\nensemble of 1,000 Monte Carlo test statistics, {Ss}. Finally, we calculate a twotailed P value with a precision of 0.001. As is customary in hypothesis testing, we\\nreject the model M at time t if the P value is less than a threshold value. We select a\\nP-value threshold of 0.05; that is, if less than 5% of the synthetic data sets exhibit\\ndeviations in the test statistic that are larger than those observed empirically, the\\nmodel is rejected at time t.\\nBecause we are conducting hypothesis tests with the fecundity distribution\\np(kjt), which is a distribution with a discrete support, it is important to use a test\\nstatistic S that is appropriate for testing discrete distributions. We use the x2 test\\nstatistic whereby we bin p(kjt) such that each bin has at least one expected\\nobservation according to the model M(Ht). This binning prevents observations\\nthat are exceptionally rare from dominating our statistical test and skewing our\\nresults.\\nRandom-network generation. We use the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm25,26 to build random networks from the mathematician genealogy network. The standard version of this algorithm inherently preserves the\\nfecundity of each individual, but it does not preserve the chronology of child\\nbirths, {tc}, for each parent. To obtain random networks belonging to ensemble I\\nor ensemble II, we restrict the switching of end points of links p that belong to the\\nsame link class L, where the link classes are defined as LI(t) 5 {p R cjtc 5 t} and\\nLII(s, t) 5 {p R cjtp 5 s, tc 5 t} for networks from ensembles I and II, respectively.\\nEach link class can be thought of as a subgraph, which can then be randomized\\nusing the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Here, we attempt 100 switches\\nper link in each link class, which sufficiently alters random networks away from\\nthe original empirical network25,26. We repeat this procedure 1,000 times to\\ngenerate a set of 1,000 random networks for each ensemble.\\nAverage-fecundity z-score. The average of variates drawn from p(kcjtc) is normally\\ndistributed because p(kcjtc) is well described by a mixture of discrete exponential\\ndistributions\\xe2\\x80\\x94a distribution with finite variance\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, thus, the central limit\\ntheorem applies. Given a set of child fecundities, Kc 5 {kc}, we quantify how\\nsignificantly a subset, Kc*, of these child fecundities deviates from Kc, by measuring\\nthe z-score of \\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6, the average child fecundity of all nodes within the subset Kc*,\\ncompared with \\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6s, the average child fecundity computed for children within a\\nsubset equivalent to Kc* in the synthetic networks. That is, we compute\\nz 5 (\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6 2 m)/s, where m is the ensemble average of {\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6s} and s is the standard\\ndeviation of the ensemble {\\xc3\\x86kc\\xc3\\xa6s} over the 1,000 realizations generated for our null\\nmodels.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa92010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
